## Mastering package dependencies


Besides having to write dependable code yourself (which might require some *defensive programming*, see Section \@ref()), we also have to worry about dependencies of R packages, that is, code written by other R users.

```{block2, type = "rmdreading"}

First scan through the section on R Packages (\@ref(packages)) to make sure you grasp all the fundamentals of R packages.

```


### What version?

When an external package has changed on CRAN since you last used it, the *version* will have changed. You can inspect the version of a package with,

```{r}
packageVersion("dplyr")
```

In a script, you can make sure a package is loaded with *at least* some version:

```{r}
packageVersion("dplyr") > "0.8.1"
```

Which you can use like,

```{r}
if(packageVersion("dplyr") < "0.8.1"){
  stop("First update the dplyr package!")
}
```

### Avoiding conflicts

To make sure you use a function from the intended package, you can use the `::` operator. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
out <- dplyr::select(mtcars, cyl, disp)
```

In this example, we avoid a common problem with `select` and other functions in packages with very general names.

When writing packages and other production-level code, the use of `::` is strongly recommended. In practice in writing dependable scripts, I recommend using `::` where practical, and less for functions that have obviously unique names in the context.

Finally, one way to avoid conflicts is to use as few packages as possible, as described in a later section.


### The search path and conflicts

After you load a package with `library()`, it is added to the *search path*. This is an order of environments where R will look for the value of some object - often an R function.

Use `search` to inspect the current search path:

```{r}
search()
```

When you type a function in R, like `summary()`, where will R find the definition of that function? In the search path above, it **starts at first environment** (where environments are packages, the global environment (what you see in the Environment pane in Rstudio), and some others). The search continues until a function is found with the name `summary`, and then R stops searching.

If you have **conflicts**, where the name of a function is defined in more than one package, the order in which you loaded the packages will affect from which package the function will actually be used. However, do not use this fact as a way to manage package dependencies, instead read the next section carefully.

To find the actual **location of the package files** on your system, use the following command (this might be helpful to archive all actual package files used in a project).

```{r}
searchpaths()
```



### All packages: loaded or installed

To list all loaded packages, do:

```{r}
pck <- .packages()
pck
```

And to list all *installed* packages,

```{r eval=FALSE}
.packages(TRUE)
```



### Bundling package dependencies with `renv`


If you want to be able to run your project a long time after you created it, one of the packages may have changed - causing an error or unexpected result. Although this is comparatively rare, it is still a possibility you want to avoid.

If we transport the script to another location, how can we be sure that the code will be working? Sometimes, newer versions of packages break old code, and in some cases packages are no longer hosted on CRAN after some time (though this is rare).

Another problem arises because all your R projects normally share the same library of R packages on your machine. That means that if you install a newer version in one project, it might cause code to stop working *in another project*. 

The new `renv` package by Rstudio is at the time of writing the best solution to creating a project that is truly portable, since we can transport the packages alongside with the code.

```{block2, type="rmdtry"}
Please read the documentation and installation instructions here: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/.
```

In practice, we basically just run this command once in a new (or existing) project:

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::init()
```

```{block2, type = "rmdcaution"}
The above command can take >10min to execute.
```

All package dependencies are downloaded and kept in a special `renv` subfolder (the original source code for all the packages).

After initializing `renv` in a directory, you can keep using `install.packages` and `library` as usual, the packages are now installed in your local `renv` folder, and in a global **cache** which `renv` manages for you.

If you are using, say package version 1.2, and version 1.3 is installed on your machine from a different project, the `renv` project will still use 1.2, unless we update this package locally ourselves (simply with `install.packages`).


### Minimizing package dependencies

Although a solution like `renv` can help us to make scripts reproducable, in practice this rule of thumb is a valuable lesson:

**Use as few external packages in your code as possible**

Complicated projects tend to break easily, and often external R packages are to blame. 

- Don't use packages when you only use one simple function from it. In that case, copy the function to your own code base, and `source` it in a script.

- Try to use packages that are still in active development, have a significant user- (or fan-) base, such as the `tidyverse` packages, and are popular.

These warnings should not shy you away from exploring the great universe of >15000 R packages that are now publicly available, chances are some obscure analysis or method is already implemented.

## A logical structure for your scripts



### Write functions, not long scripts

If a script becomes too long, write more functions. Writing your own functions is the most important advise if you want to write and maintain robust, complex projects.

As pointed out in the Chapter on Project management (\@ref(projectman)), save these functions separately, for example "R/functions.R", and `source` them with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("R/functions.R")
```

Unfortunately `source` is not vectorized, so to read all R scripts from a subdirectory you can simply do,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for(fn in dir("R", pattern = "[.]R$", full.names = TRUE)){
  source(fn)
}
```


```{block2, type = "rmdtry"}
Write the above snippet into a function, which takes the directory to search as an argument.
```




### Divide your script into functional blocks


Dividing your scripts into a few functional blocks can help readability and reliability. 
With special formatting, you can even improve the *table of contents* (TOC) menu in Rstudio for a script. Run the example below, and then find the TOC button in Rstudio:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/tablecontents_button.png")
```

**Access the (nearly) automatic TOC in Rstudio**


In the following example script, note that we load all packages at the beginning of the script, so that when something goes wrong at that stage, we know before executing any of the 'real' code.

Also note the use of `#-----`, this helps to make the TOC as mentioned above.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# An example script
# 2020, Author


#----- Load packages -----
library(dplyr)
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(glue)

#----- Custom functions -----
source("R/functions.R")
source("R/database_functions.R")

#----- Configuration -----

# Load configuration (passwords etc., see next Section!)
.conf <- yaml::read_yaml(file = "config.yml")

#----- Database -----

# Make database connection
db_con <- make_database_connection_knmi(.conf)

# Download data
cloud_data <- download_cloud_data(con = db_con)

# Archive the data
fn <- glue("archive/out_{Sys.Date()}.rds")
try(saveRDS(cloud_data, fn), silent = TRUE)

#----- Visualization -----

# Make visuals
make_cloud_maps(data = cloud_data)

#----- Model -----

# Do some advanced modelling
model_run <- run_cloudy_model(data = cloud_data)

# Upload the model results to a remote database
upload_model_db16(model_run, config = .conf)

```

The *fictional* script above is just an example how you can divide a *master script* into logical statements, using functions that perform all the underlying tasks.

One major advantage of the above approach is because functions execute their "inner workings" in a **separate environment**, which means that objects inside a function are not visible either outside the function (like the main script) or in any other script. 

That way, executing the script above does not produce any objects in the environment (the memory) other than the ones *returned* by the functions. All the intermediate objects that were executed inside each function have disappeared, freeing memory and avoiding conflicts.


## Pay attention to detail: write clean code

You may not want to spend the time making sure your code is neatly formatted, but it helps tremendously in a) spotting syntax errors while you write, and b) make your code vastly more readable by another person.

Unlike a language like Python, in R you are incredibly free to format your code (with spaces, tabs, newlines) pretty much however you want. Although this gives the programmer a lot of room for creative (and short) code, it can also be frustrating because it makes some code hard to read (when it is "poorly" formatted).

```{block2, type = "rmdreading"}
I find *Google's style guide* a very neat an readable way to indent and format R code: https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html
```

```{block2, type = "rmdtry"}
If you would like to use a tool that checks your code for various superficial (and some less superficial) problems, try using `lintr` : https://github.com/jimhester/lintr (I find it too restrictive and too opinionated, but you will certainly learn a lot by going through the process).
